##Notes from meeting
- play w/ fig size - make easier to read titles/ticks on data summary charts
- include an aggregate trend of all cities overtime (before other individual group graphs)
- Group cities by housing prices, keep groups consistent throughout analysis
- potential issue slide - short timespan
- regression output to table (maybe in excel)
- could go into detail ab other factors for certain cities where observation is interesting
